# Traffic-Light-Controller
Designed a 5-state Moore FSM traffic light controller in Verilog controlling Highway (HW) and Crossroad (CR) signals. Based on input `x`, it sequences through Green–Yellow–Red transitions with synchronous state updates and asynchronous reset. Testbench generates clock, stimulus, and monitors state and light outputs for verification.
